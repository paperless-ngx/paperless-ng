        If you encounter issues while installing or configuring Paperless-ngx, please post in the ["Support" section of the discussions](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/discussions/new?category=support). Remember that Paperless successfully runs on a variety of different systems. If Paperless-ngx does not start, it's likely an issue with your system, not an issue of Paperless-ngx.
