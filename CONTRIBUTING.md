# Contributing

If you feel that somethings is not working, please submit an issue. You can also ask questions on the issue tracker by tagging your question with the question tag.

Pull requests are welcome, however, I will be a little bit more strict about what goes into the code and what does not. If you want to make a big change, please ask me about it first.

* When making additions to the project, consider if the majority of users will benefit from your change. If not, you're probably better of forking the project.
* Also consider if your change will get in the way of other users. A good change is a change that enhances the experience of some users who want that change and does not affect users who do not care about the change.

However:

* Bug fixes and are always welcome. Docker makes things easier, however, I alone cannot ensure that this runs on all platforms.
* Improvements to the styling of the front-end are always welcome. I'm no expert in things UX, and simply copied one of the Bootstrap examples. I think it turned out rather good, but I just can't seem to get some things working properly.
