# Environment variables to set for Paperless
# Commented out variables will be replaced with a default within Paperless.
#
# In addition to what you see here, you can also define any values you find in
# paperless.conf.example here.  Values like:
#
# * PAPERLESS_PASSPHRASE
# * PAPERLESS_CONSUME_MAIL_HOST
#
# ...are all explained in that file but can be defined here, since the Docker
# installation doesn't make use of paperless.conf.

# Use this variable to set a timezone for the Paperless Docker containers. If not specified, defaults to UTC.
#TZ=America/Los_Angeles

# Additional languages to install for text recognition.  Note that this is
# different from PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE (default=eng), which defines the
# default language used when guessing the language from the OCR output.
# The container installs English, German, Italian, Spanish and French by
# default.
#PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGES=deu ita spa fra

# The UID and GID of the user used to run paperless in the container. Set this
# to your UID and GID on the host so that you have write access to the
# consumption directory.
