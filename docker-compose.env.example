# Adjust this key if you plan to make paperless available publicly. It should

# Use this variable to set a timezone for the Paperless Docker containers. If not specified, defaults to UTC.

# The default language to use for OCR. Set this to the language most of your
# documents are written in.
#PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE="eng"

# By default Paperless does not OCR a document if the text can be retrieved from
# the document directly. Set to true to always OCR documents. (i.e., if you
# know that some of your documents have faulty/bad OCR data)
#PAPERLESS_OCR_ALWAYS="true"
